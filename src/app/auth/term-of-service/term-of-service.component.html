        <p class="termsandconditions_para1">Date of Last Revision: May 22nd, 2018 </p>

        <p class="termsandconditions_para1">Please Read Carefully Before Using This Website: The following terms of
            service (“Terms of Service”) govern your use of the Alore Sites (the “Site”) and the Alore web-based,
            application integration and data linking service accessed through the Site (“Service”), both of which
            are operated by Plash Pte.Ltd, Inc. (“Plash” or “we” or 'us"). By using the Site and/or the Service, you
            irrevocably agree that such use is subject to these Terms of Service. If you do not agree to these Terms
            of Service, you may not use the Site or the Service. If you are entering into these Terms of Service on
            behalf of an entity, you are binding such entity to these Terms of Service, you represent that you have
            the actual authority to bind such entity to these Terms of Service, and references to “you” mean such
            entity.</p>


        <p class="termsandconditions_para1">Plash expressly reserves the right to modify the Terms of Service at any
            time in its sole discretion by including such alteration and/or modification in these Terms of Service,
            along with a notice of the effective date of such modified Terms of Service. If a revision meaningfully
            reduces your rights, we will use reasonable efforts to notify you (by, for example, sending an email to
            the billing contact you designate in your User Account (as defined below), through your User Account or
            in the Service itself). To the extent you have purchased a subscription to the Service, the modified
            terms will be effective as to such subscription Service upon your next subscription renewal. In this
            case, if you object to the updated terms, as your exclusive remedy, you may choose not to renew,
            including cancelling any terms set to auto-renew. In all other cases, any continued use by you of the
            Site or the Service after the posting of such modified Terms of Service shall be deemed to indicate your
            irrevocable agreement to such modified Terms of Service. Accordingly, if at any time you do not agree to
            be subject to any modified Terms of Service, you may no longer use the Site or Service.It is a legal
            document so some of the language is necessarily “legalese”, but we have tried to make it as readable as
            possible. These terms are so important that we cannot provide our products and services to you unless
            you agree to them. By using the Subscription Service or receiving the Consulting Services, you are
            agreeing to these terms.</p>
        <p></p>



        <p class="termsandconditions_para1">We periodically update these terms. If you have an active Alore
            subscription, we will let you know when we do via an email or in-app notification.</p>

        <p class="termsandconditions_para1">Here’s a roadmap of the Agreement:</p>

        <p class="termsandconditions_para1"><span>A. DEFINITIONS.</span> This is where we provide the detail on what
            the key defined terms in the Agreement mean. You can think of this kind of like a contractual
            dictionary.</p>

        <p class="termsandconditions_para1"><span>B. GENERAL COMMERCIAL TERMS.</span> Here’s where you can find the
            basics about how our Subscription Service and Consulting Services are provided. For example, you can
            find information on access and acceptable use. These terms apply to all of our products and service
            offerings.</p>

        <p class="termsandconditions_para1"><span>C. SUBSCRIPTION TERMS.</span> Customers of ours subscribe to use
            our software and there are some fundamental terms that apply to each subscription. There are some
            differences between the different types of subscriptions, and here’s where you can find that detail.</p>

        <p class="termsandconditions_para1"><span>D. PRODUCT DISCLOSURES.</span> We offer several different products
            and there are some important things to know before you use them. We’ve collected these important things
            to know and you can find them here.</p>

        <p class="termsandconditions_para1"><span>E. GENERAL LEGAL TERMS.</span> As we mention above, this is a
            contract, and contracts are filled with legal terms. In this section, we’ve collected the many of the
            remaining legal terms that make up our Customer Terms of Service.</p>

        <p class="termsandconditions_para1"><span>F. JURISDICTION SPECIFIC TERMS.</span> With customers across the
            globe, this final section is where we address most of the differences in these terms that vary based on
